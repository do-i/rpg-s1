# Release manager.
#
# The interactive front-end lives in menu.toml (lazymenu-cli); this script only
# takes explicit subcommands.
#
# Versioning:
#   - Calendar versioning, year.month.sequence, tagged v<version> (e.g.
#     v2026.8.1). The sequence is computed from existing tags for the current
#     month, so the common case needs no version argument.
#   - The version is NOT derived at build time: release.yml builds from
#     Cargo.toml and refuses to publish when the tag and Cargo.toml disagree,
#     so a release has to bump Cargo.toml (and Cargo.lock, which records the
#     version too, and which the release build reads with --locked). This
#     script makes that bump on dev, as its own commit, and waits for CI on it
#     before tagging.
#
# Branching model:
#   - `dev` is the integration branch, and the branch this script must be run
#     from. Feature branches merge into it.
#   - `main` never receives commits directly. It only ever advances by a
#     fast-forward of `dev` (done here), followed by a tag. A direct push to
#     main breaks that invariant; this script detects it and refuses rather
#     than guessing what to do.
#
# What "cut" does:
#   1. Refuses a dirty tree, or a local dev with unpushed commits (they'd be
#      silently left out), or an origin/main that is not an ancestor of
#      origin/dev (a direct push to main since the last release).
#   2. Bumps Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock to the new version and pushes that commit
#      to dev, unless Cargo.toml is already at the target version.
#   3. Waits for a green ci.yml run on dev's tip.
#   4. Fast-forwards main to that commit, tags it, and pushes both atomically.
#
# Pushing the tag starts release.yml, which builds the Linux x86_64 release
# binary, bundles it with assets/, and attaches the tarball to the GitHub
# release.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release.sh status               # show state, change nothing
#   scripts/release.sh cut                  # cut a release
#   scripts/release.sh cut 2026.8.4         # cut an explicit version
#   scripts/release.sh --dry-run cut        # show what would happen
#   scripts/release.sh --skip-ci-check cut  # bypass the CI gate
#   scripts/release.sh --yes cut            # skip the confirmation prompt
